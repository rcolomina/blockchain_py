This project creates a simple blockchain using python:

# First starts importing datetime and hashlib libraries
to create timestamps and target hashes for the blocks.

# Seconds the block class is defined on its main elements with a
hash function that sumarizes the attributes of a block
     nonce
     data
     previous hash
     timestamp
     block number
      

# Third the blockchain class is defined implementing two methods
      add  a block
      mine a block

# Finally this will create a blockchian mining the block and printing out.
